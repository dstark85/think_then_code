# A collection of Challenging Programs

## Programming Pearls

    Probably my favorite little book. The problems come from a simpler time ~90s where memory and computational resources were scarce. 
    Thus, the focus is on squeezing every last bit of efficiency from the mind before the machine.

## The Practice of Programming
    
    Another gem from the old days. In fact, Kernighan is the K from K&R and Pike is a legendary programmer in his own right.
    The message throughout is that programming is a craft - one to be honed and developed through effort and dilligence.

## BrainSplat

    My spontaneous foray into the awesome language BrainFuck. The language feels like a game. You're given a simple set of commands, 
    and with only those, the combinational complexity of them causes your brain to ... you know. My version simply adds a few more 
    convenience commands.
